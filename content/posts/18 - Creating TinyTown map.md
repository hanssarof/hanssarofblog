title: 18 - Creating TinyTown map

Until now, I had only a test map with a basic terrain so I decided to dedicate some time to the level design. I started by drafting a map of a small town block in a desert valley. My idea was to create a map with 3 attack paths for the snakes:
- One road from the North passing under a railway acting as a barrier
- One canyon coming from the mountain on the East
- One road coming from the West
