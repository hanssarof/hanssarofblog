      <title>22 - GameMode logic, win or defeat, score and UI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my detour through the weapon actions, I returned to the game loop logic. I started by creating a &lt;code&gt;DesertDefenderGameMode&lt;/code&gt; class and used it for the TinyTown level. I added four functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ActivateSpawners()&lt;/code&gt;, called from &lt;code&gt;PostLogin()&lt;/code&gt;, to manage &lt;code&gt;SpawnPoints&lt;/code&gt; and introduce a warmup delay before starting fight snakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PlayerEliminated()&lt;/code&gt;, which sends the player back to the MainMenu map when he is killed by the snakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BasePointDestroyed()&lt;/code&gt;, which sends the player back to the MainMenu map when the base is destroyed by the snakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PlayerWon()&lt;/code&gt;, which sends the player back to the MainMenu map when he wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>21 - Show, hide and switch equipped weapon actions and AnimBP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have already implemented the ability for the coyote to pick up a weapon. When he does, he can no longer walk on all fours, and his MaxWalk speed is reduced. This makes it harder to escape from the snakes chasing the player, and it leaves only a short window to benefit from the increased speed before picking up a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To offer better gameplay, I have had the idea from the very beginning to allow the player to holster or put away the weapon and return to an Unequipped state. The player would then be able to take the weapon from coyote back to shoot again, or switch weapons if a secondary weapon is equipped. As in a game like Apex Legends, I wanted to separate the controls for these actions: one key to show or hide the weapon, and the mouse wheel to switch between weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>20 - Thinking on the game loop and starting the UI</title>
      <link>https://blog.desert-defender.com/posts/20---thinking-on-the-game-loop-and-starting-the-ui/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, I have been working on the game without taking the time to write down the logic of the game loop. But without it, it is not possible to start working on the GameState or on the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started by drawing a diagram with a basic color scheme: white background means I am sure about the step, yellow means it will be in the game but I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how it will be setup and red means that I am not sure about the step so it is not a priority as this point. For exemple in the picture bellow, working on a story introduction video or on some kind of items store does not make any sense for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>19 - Unsyncing ennemies animations on spawn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the start, I had a problem with the snakes and their animations: they were all synchronized with each other. This made their movement very unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, I decided to get around it with the simplest possible solution: add a small delay between each snake spawn. I divided the existant SpawnPoint SpawnActor function to make it more readable and now the loop adds a small random delay between every spawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>18 - Creating the TinyTown map</title>
      <link>https://blog.desert-defender.com/posts/18---creating-the-tinytown-map/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.desert-defender.com/posts/18---creating-the-tinytown-map/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until now, I had only a test map with a basic terrain so I decided to spend some on level design. I started by drafting a map of a small town blocked in a valley and blocked by a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to create a map with 3 attack paths for the snakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One road from the north passing under a railway acting as a barrier for the player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One canyon coming to the east&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One road coming from the west&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
